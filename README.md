Traditional approaches to network traffic management often rely on statistical models, such as time-series analysis, autocorrelation, and linear regression, to predict future traffic patterns based on historical data. While these methods have been foundational in early network management practices, they are increasingly inadequate in handling the complexities of modern, high-volume networks where traffic patterns are not linear and can change rapidly.
  In contrast, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these limitations. AI techniques are well-suited for network traffic prediction because they can capture nonlinear, complex relationships within large datasets, adapt to changing traffic patterns, and offer real-time forecasting and optimization capabilities. Through techniques like neural networks, reinforcement learning, and ensemble learning models, AI can enable intelligent traffic management that reduces congestion, optimizes bandwidth allocation, and ensures high availability.
